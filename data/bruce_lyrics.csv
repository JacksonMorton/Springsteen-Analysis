"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.",Blinded by the Light,Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
,,In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
,,With a boulder on my shoulder feelin' kinda older I tripped the merry-go-round
,,With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope crashed to the ground
,,Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot snappin' his fingers clappin' his hands
,,And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
,,And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
,,And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers daddy's within earshot save the buckshot turn up the band
,,
,,And she was blinded by the light
,,Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
,,Blinded by the light
,,"She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright"
,,
,,Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
,,"He says: ""Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least"""
,,And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone watchin' the young girls dance
,,And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance
,,
,,Yeah he was blinded by the light
,,Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
,,Blinded by the light
,,"He got down but she never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight"
,,
,,Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
,,"She said I'll turn you on sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break,"
,,And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
,,"And little Early-Pearly came in by her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride,"
,,"Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playin' backyard bombardier"
,,"Yes and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent a dude with a calling card,"
,,"he said, do what you like, but don't do it here"
,,"Well I jumped up, turnedaround, spit in the air, fell on the ground"
,,Asked him which was the way back home
,,"He said take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then boy, you're on your own"
,,
,,And now in Zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car hummin' a lunar tune
,,"Yes, and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon"
,,
,,"And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night,"
,,
,,Well I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw
,,a gap but figured he'd be all right
,,
,,He was just blinded by the light
,,Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
,,Blinded by the light
,,Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
,,Oh but mama that's where the fun isØ
"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.",Growin' Up,I stood stone-like at midnight suspended in my masquerade
,,I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
,,I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
,,I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched
,,"I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said ""Sit down"" I stood up."
,,Ooh-ooh growin' up
,,
,,"The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing"
,,"I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing,"
,,I pushed B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
,,"I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing,"
,,"I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said ""Come down"" I threw up"
,,Ooh-ooh growin' up
,,
,,I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard to hold your breath.
,,"I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress"
,,"Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little place in the stars"
,,And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
,,"I hid in the mother breast of the crowd but when they said ""Pull down"" I pulled up"
,,Ooh-ooh growin' up. Ooh-ooh growin' upØ
,Mary Queen of Arkansas,"Mary Queen of Arkansas, it's not too early for dreamin'"
,,The sky is grown with cloud seed sown and a bastard's love can be redeeming
,,"Mary, my queen, your soft hulk is reviving"
,,"No, you're not too late to desecrate, the servants are just rising"
,,"Well I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade"
,,I've been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state
,,"Mary, my queen, your blows for freedom are missing"
,,You're not man enough for me to hate or woman enough for kissing
,,
,,"The big top is for dreamers, we can take the circus all the way to the border"
,,And the gallows wait for martyrs whose papers are in order
,,But I was not born to live to die and you were not born for queenin'
,,"It's not too late to infiltrate, the servants are just leavin'"
,,
,,"Mary queen of Arkansas, your white skin is deceivin'"
,,You wake and wait to lie in bait and you almost got me believin'
,,But on your bed Mary I can see the shadow of a noose
,,I don't understand how you can hold me so tight and love me so damn loose
,,
,,But I know a place where we can go Mary
,,Where I can get a good job and start all over again clean
,,I got contacts deep in Mexico where the servants have been seenØ
,Does this Bus Stop at 82nd Street?,"Hey bus driver keep the change, bless your children, give them names,"
,,don't trust men who walk with canes
,,drink this and you'll grow wings on your feet
,,"Broadway Mary, Joan Fontaine, advertiser on a downtown train"
,,"Christmas crier bustin' cane, he's in love again."
,,
,,Where dock worker's dreams mix with panther's schemes to someday own the rodeo
,,Tainted women in Vistavision perform for out-of-state kids at the late show.
,,
,,"Wizard imps and sweat sock pimps, interstellar mongrel nymphs"
,,Rex said that lady left him limp. Love's like that (sure it is).
,,"Queen of diamonds, ace of spades, newly discovered lovers of the everglades"
,,They take out a full page ad in the trades to announce their arrival
,,"And Mary Lou she found out how to cope, she rides to heaven on a gyroscope"
,,The Daily News asks her for the dope
,,"She says ""Man, the dope's that there's still hope""."
,,
,,"Senorita, Spanish rose, wipes her eyes and blows her nose"
,,"Uptown in Harlem she throw a rose to some lucky, young matador.Ø"
,Lost in the Flood,The ragamuffin gunner is returnin' home like a hungry runaway
,,He walks through town all alone
,,He must be from the fort he hears the high school girls say
,,His countryside's burnin' with wolfman fairies dressed in drag for homicide
,,"The hit and run, plead sanctuary, 'neath a holy stone they hide"
,,They're breakin' beams and crosses with a spastic's reelin' perfection
,,"nuns run bald through Vatican halls pregnant, pleadin' immaculate conception"
,,And everybody's wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood
,,"Sticker smiles sweet as gunner breathes deep, his ankles caked in mud"
,,"And I said ""Hey, gunner man, that's quicksand, that's quicksand that ain't mud"
,,"Have you thrown your senses to the war or did you lose them in the flood?"""
,,
,,"That pure American brother, dull-eyed and empty-faced"
,,races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight
,,"He rides 'er low on the hip, on the side he's got Bound For Glory in red, white and blue flash paint"
,,"He leans on the hood telling racing stories, the kids call him Jimmy The Saint"
,,"Well the blaze and noise boy, he's gunnin' that bitch loaded to blastin' point"
,,He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point
,,And there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell
,,"That is, nothin' left that you could sell"
,,"just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell"
,,"And he said ""Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil that's blood"""
,,I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm
,,Or was he just lost in the flood?
,,Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air
,,"Some storefront incarnation of Maria, she's puttin' on me the stare"
,,and Bronx's best apostle stands with his hand on his own hardware
,,"Everything stops, you hear five, quick shots, the cops come up for air"
,,"And now the whiz-bang gang from uptown, they're shootin' up the street"
,,And that cat from the Bronx starts lettin' loose
,,but he gets blown right off his feet
,,And some kid comes blastin' round the corner but a cop puts him right away
,,He lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in Spanish
,,Still breathing when I walked away
,,"And somebody said ""Hey man did you see that? His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud"""
,,I wonder what the dude was sayin' or was he just lost in the flood?
,,"Hey man, did you see that, those poor cats are sure messed up"
,,"I wonder what they were gettin' into, or were they just lost in the flood?Ø"
,The Angel,"The angel rides with hunch-backed children, poison oozing from his engine"
,,"Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven"
,,"Baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked"
,,The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires strokes his precious pavement
,,
,,The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes
,,in Volkswagen vans with full running boards dragging great anchors
,,Followin' dead-end signs into the sores
,,The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore
,,
,,Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain
,,She rubs against the weather-beaten frame and asks the angel for his name
,,Off in the distance the marble dome
,,reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown
,,The woman strokes his polished chrome and lies beside the angel's bones.
,For You,Princess cards she sends me with her regards
,,"barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard"
,,"Wounded deep in battle, I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted"
,,"To her Cheshire smile. I'll stand on file, she's all I ever wanted."
,,But you let your blue walls get in the way of these facts
,,"honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back"
,,you wouldn't even give me time to cover my tracks.
,,"You said, ""Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks""."
,,"But they're not what I came for, and I'm sure you see that too"
,,"I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not need my urgency"
,,"I came for you, for you, I came for you, but your life was one long emergency"
,,"and your cloud line urges me, and my electric surges free"
,,
,,"Crawl into my ambulance, your pulse is getting weak"
,,reveal yourself all now to me girl while you've got the strength to speak
,,Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks
,,But I could give it all to you now if only you could ask.
,,And don't call for your surgeon even he says it's too late
,,"It's not your lungs this time, it's your heart that holds your fate"
,,"Don't give me money, honey, I don't want it back"
,,you and your pony face and your union jack
,,well take your local joker and teach him how to act
,,I swear I was never that way even when I really cracked
,,Didn't you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive
,,able to leap tall buildings in a single bound?
,,And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive
,,you could laugh and cry in a single sound.
,,
,,And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds
,,Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god?
,,
,,You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach
,,Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach
,,And the band they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek
,,"That ragged, jagged melody she still clings to me like a leech."
,,But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way
,,like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way
,,We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar
,,"of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore"
,,"So you, left to find a better reason than the one we were living for"
,,and it's not that nursery mouth I came back for
,,It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor
,,cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors
,,And who am I to ask you to lick my sores?
,,And you should know that's true...
,,"I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not need my urgency"
,,"I came for you, for you, I came for you, but your life was one long emergency"
,,"and your cloud line urges me, and my electric surges freeØ"
,Spirit in the Night,Crazy Janey and her mission man were back in the alley tradin' hands
,,'long came Wild Billy with his friend G-man all duded up for Saturday night
,,Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake
,,It's about a mile down on the dark side of route eighty-eight
,,I got a bottle of rose so let's try it
,,We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
,,They're built like light
,,and they dance like spirits in the night (all night) in the night (all night)
,,"Oh, you don't know what they can do to you"
,,"Spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)"
,,Stand right up now and let it shoot through you
,,
,,Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap.
,,"He said, ""Trust some of this it'll show you where you're at, or at least it'll help you really feel it"""
,,By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
,,I think I really dug her 'cause I was too loose to fake
,,"I said, ""I'm hurt."" She said, ""Honey let me heal it""."
,,And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
,,and she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
,,"She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night (all night)"
,,In the night (all night). Janey don't know what she do to you
,,"Like a spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night)"
,,Stand right up and let her shoot through me.
,,
,,Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
,,dancin' in the moonlight
,,They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
,,Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
,,"Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt"
,,Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
,,Janey said it was time to go
,,"So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right"
,,"Together we moved like spirits in the night, all night"
,,Baby don't know what they can do to you
,,"Spirits in the night, all night"
,,Stand right up and let it shoot right through youØ
,It's So Hard to be a Saint in the City,I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
,,I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
,,I could walk like Brando right into the sun
,,Then dance just like a Casanova
,,With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
,,Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat
,,When I strut down the street I could hear its heartbeat
,,"The sisters fell back and said ""Don't that man look pretty"""
,,"The cripple on the corner cried out ""Nickels for your pity"""
,,Them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty
,,It's so hard to be a saint in the city
,,
,,"I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash"
,,I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash
,,I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everything cool
,,Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
,,And when the heat came down it was left on the ground
,,The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street
,,Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat
,,I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
,,It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street
,,
,,And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
,,As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead
,,They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
,,But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
,,You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat
,,Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet
,,Then you're outa that hole and back up on the street
,,
,,And them South Side sisters sure look pretty
,,"The cripple on the corner cries out ""Nickels for your pity"""
,,And them downtown boys sure talk gritty
,,It's so hard to be a saint in the cityØ

,,The pier lights our carnival life on the water

,,Well he ain't my boss no more Sandy

,,"Sandy, the angels have lost our desire for us"
,,I spoke to 'em just last night and they said they won't set themselves on fire for us anymore

,,They haunt this dusty beach road
,,In the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets

,,They scream your name at night in the street
,,Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet

,Night,You get up every morning at the sound of the bell
,,You get to work late and the boss man's giving you hell
,,Till you're out on a midnight run
,,Losing your heart to a beautiful one
,,And it feels right as you lock up the house

,,And the world is busting at its seams
,,And you're just a prisoner of your dreams
,,Holding on for your life 'cause you work all day
,,To blow 'em away in the night

,BACKSTREETS,One soft infested summer me and Terry became friends
,,Trying in vain to breathe the fire we was born in
,,Catching rides to the outskirts tying faith between our teeth
,,Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house getting wasted in the heat
,,"And hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets"
,,With a love so hard and filled with defeat
,,Running for our lives at night on them backstreets
,,
,,Slow dancing in the dark on the beach at Stockton's Wing
,,Where desperate lovers park we sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings
,,Huddled in our cars waiting for the bells that ring
,,In the deep heart of the night to set us loose from everything
,,"to go running on the backstreets, running on the backstreets"
,,We swore we'd live forever on the backstreets we take it together
,,
,,Endless juke joints and Valentino drag where dancers scraped the tears
,,Up off the street dressed down in rags running into the darkness
,,Some hurt bad some really dying at night sometimes it seemed
,,You could hear the whole damn city crying blame it on the lies that killed us
,,Blame it on the truth that ran us down you can blame it all on me Terry
,,It don't matter to me now when the breakdown hit at midnight
,,There was nothing left to say but I hated him and I hated you when you went away
,,
,,Laying here in the dark you're like an angel on my chest
,,Just another tramp of hearts crying tears of faithlessness
,,"Remember all the movies, Terry, we'd go see"
,,Trying to learn how to walk like heroes we thought we had to be
,,And after all this time to find we're just like all the rest
,,Stranded in the park and forced to confess
,,"To hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets"
,,We swore forever friends on the backstreets until the end
,,"Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreetsØ"
,BORN TO RUN,In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
,,At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
,,Sprung from cages on Highway 9

,,And steppin' out over the line
,,Baby this town rips the bones from your back
,,"It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap"
,,We gotta get out while we're young

,,"Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend"
,,I want to guard your dreams and visions
,,Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
,,and strap your hands across my engines
,,Together we could break this trap
,,"We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back"
,,Will you walk with me out on the wire
,,'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
,,But I gotta find out how it feels
,,I want to know if love is wild
,,girl I want to know if love is real

,,Beyond the Palace hemi powered drones scream down the boulevard
,,The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
,,And the boys try to look so hard
,,The amusement park rises bold and stark
,,Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
,,I wanna die with you out on the streets tonight
,,In an everlasting kiss
,,
,,The highway's jammed with broken heroes
,,On a last chance power drive
,,Everybody's out on the run tonight
,,but there's no place left to hide

,,I'll love you with all the madness in my soul

,She's the One,With her killer graces and her secret places
,,That no boy can fill with her hands on her hips
,,Oh and that smile on her lips
,,Because she knows that it kills me
,,With her soft french cream
,,Standing in that doorway like a dream
,,I wish she'd just leave me alone
,,Because french cream won't soften them boots
,,And french kisses will not break that heart of stone
,,With her long hair falling
,,And her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
,,"Oh-o she's the one, she's the one"
,,
,,That Thunder in your heart
,,At night when you're kneeling in the dark
,,It says you're never gonna leave her
,,But there's this angel in her eyes
,,That tells such desperate lies
,,And all you want to do is believe her
,,And tonight you'll try just one more time
,,To leave it all behind and to break on through
,,"Oh she can take you, but if she wants to break you"
,,She's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do
,,And no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run
,,"Oh-o she's the one, she's the one"

,JUNGLELAND,The rangers had a homecoming in Harlem late last night
,,And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine over the Jersey state line
,,Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
,,Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
,,The Rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
,,Together they take a stab at romance and disappear down Flamingo Lane
,,
,,Well the Maximum Lawman run down Flamingo chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl
,,"And the kids round here look just like shadows always quiet, holding hands"
,,From the churches to the jails tonight all is silence in the world
,,As we take our stand down in Jungleland

,,The midnight gang's assembled and picked a rendezvous for the night
,,They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign that brings this fair city light
,,Man there's an opera out on the Turnpike
,,There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
,,"Until the local cops, Cherry Tops, rips this holy night"
,,The street's alive as secret debts are paid
,,"Contacts made, they vanished unseen"
,,Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades hustling for the record machine
,,The hungry and the hunted explode into rock'n'roll bands
,,That face off against each other out in the street down in Jungleland
,,
,,In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
,,Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the D.J. plays
,,Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
,,"Desperate as the night moves on, just a look and a whisper, and they're gone"
,,
,,Beneath the city two hearts beat
,,Soul engines running through a night so tender in a bedroom locked
,,In whispers of soft refusal and then surrender in the tunnels uptown
,,The Rat's own dream guns him down as shots echo down them hallways in the night
,,No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
,,Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
,,
,,Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
,,Between flesh and what's fantasy and the poets down here
,,"Don't write nothing at all, they just stand back and let it all be"
,,And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
,,"And try to make an honest stand but they wind up wounded, not even dead"
,,Tonight in JunglelandØ

,DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN,They're still racing out at the Trestles
,,But that blood it never burned in her veins
,,Now I hear she's got a house up in Fairview
,,And a style she's trying to maintain
,,Well if she wants to see me
,,You can tell her that I'm easily found
,,Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge
,,And tell her there's a darkness on the edge of town
,,
,,Everybody's got a secret Sonny
,,Something that they just can't face
,,Some folks spend their whole lives trying to keep it
,,They carry it with them every step that they take
,,Till some day they just cut it loose
,,Cut it loose or let it drag 'em down
,,Where no one asks any questions
,,Or looks too long in your face
,,In the darkness on the edge of town
,,
,,Some folks are born into a good life
,,Other folks get it anyway anyhow
,,I lost my money and I lost my wife
,,Them things don't seem to matter much to me now
,,Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cause I can't stop
,,I'll be on that hill with everything I got
,,Lives on the line where dreams are found and lost
,,I'll be there on time and I'll pay the cost
,,For wanting things that can only be found
,,In the darkness on the edge of townØ

,,We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
,,but all he kept talking about was
,,
,,Glory days well they'll pass you by
,,Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
,,"Glory days, glory days"
,,
,,Well there's a girl that lives up the block
,,back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
,,Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
,,and have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
,,Her and her husband Bobby well they split up
,,I guess it's two years gone by now
,,"We just sit around talking about the old times,"
,,she says when she feels like crying
,,she starts laughing thinking about
,,
,,Glory days well they'll pass you by
,,Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
,,"Glory days, glory days"
,,
,,Now I think I'm going down to the well tonight
,,and I'm going to drink till I get my fill
,,And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it

,MY HOMETOWN,I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
,,Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
,,I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town
,,He'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around this is your hometown
,,This is your hometown
,,This is your hometown
,,This is your hometown
,,
,,In '65 tension was running high at my high school
,,There was a lot of fights between the black and white
,,There was nothing you could do
,,Two cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun
,,Words were passed in a shotgun blast
,,Troubled times had come to my hometown
,,My hometown
,,My hometown
,,My hometown
,,
,,Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
,,Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
,,They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
,,Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back to your hometown
,,Your hometown
,,Your hometown
,,Your hometown
,,
,,Last night me and Kate we laid in bed
,,talking about getting out
,,Packing up our bags maybe heading south
,,I'm thirty-five we got a boy of our own now
,,Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around
,,This is your hometownØ

,SPARE PARTS,Bobby said he'd pull out Bobby stayed in
,,Janey had a baby it wasn't any sin
,,They were set to marry on a summer day
,,Bobby got scared and he ran away
,,Jane moved in with her ma out on Shawnee Lake
,,She sighed Ma sometimes my whole life feels like one big mistake
,,She settled in in a back room time passed on
,,Later that winter a son came along
,,
,,Spare parts
,,And broken hearts
,,Keep the world turnin' around
,,
,,Now Janey walked that baby across the floor night after night
,,But she was a young girl and she missed the party lights
,,Meanwhile in South Texas in a dirty oil patch
,,Bobby heard 'bout his son bein' born and swore he wasn't ever goin' back
,,
,,Spare parts
,,And broken hearts
,,Keep the world turnin' around
,,
,,Janey heard about a woman over in Calverton
,,Put her baby in the river let the river roll on
,,She looked at her boy in the crib where he lay
,,Got down on her knees cried till she prayed
,,Mist was on the water low run the tide
,,Janey held her son down at the riverside
,,Waist deep in water how bright the sun shone
,,She lifted him in her arms and carried him home
,,As he lay sleeping in her bed Janey took a look around at everything
,,Went to a drawer in her bureau and got out her old engagement ring
,,Took out her wedding dress tied that ring up in its sash
,,Went straight down to the pawn shop man and walked out with some good cold cash
,,
,,Spare parts
,,And broken hearts
,,Keep the world turnin' around
,CAUTIOUS MAN,Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road
,,He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code
,,When something caught his eye he'd measure his need
,,And then very carefully he'd proceed
,,
,,Billy met a young girl in the early days of May
,,It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away
,,In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim
,,He'd lay back in her arms and laugh at what had happened to him
,,
,,On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the word fear
,,And in which hand he held his fate was never clear
,,Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride
,,And with his own hands built a great house down by the riverside
,,
,,Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right
,,He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights
,,Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray
,,For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay
,,
,,One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name
,,"She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep, a thousand miles away"
,,He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode
,,When he got there he didn't find nothing but road
,,
,,Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name
,,Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain
,,At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on her skin so white
,,Filling their room with the beauty of God's fallen light
,WALK LIKE A MAN,I remember how rough your hand felt on mine
,,On my wedding day
,,And the tears cried on my shoulder
,,I couldn't turn away
,,Well so much has happened to me
,,That I don't understand
,,All I can think of is being five years old following behind you at the beach
,,Tracing your footprints in the sand
,,Trying to walk like a man
,,
,,By Our Lady Of The Roses
,,We lived in the shadow of the elms
,,I remember ma draggin' me and my sister up the street to the church
,,Whenever she heard those wedding bells
,,Well would they ever look so happy again
,,The handsome groom and his bride
,,As they stepped into that long black limousine
,,For their mystery ride
,,Well tonight you step away from me
,,And alone at the alter I stand
,,And as I watch my bride coming down the aisle I pray
,,For the strength to walk like a man
,,
,,Well now the years have gone and I've grown
,,From that seed you've sown
,,But I didn't think there'd be so many steps
,,I'd have to learn on my own
,,Well I was young and I didn't know what to do
,,When I saw your best steps stolen away from you
,,Now I'll do what I can
,,I'll walk like a man
,,And I'll keep on walkin'
,TUNNEL OF LOVE,Fat man sitting on a little stool
,,Takes the money from my hand while his eyes take a walk all over you
,,Hands me the ticket smiles and whispers good luck
,,Cuddle up angel cuddle up my little dove
,,We'll ride down baby into this tunnel of love
,,
,,I can feel the soft silk of your blouse
,,And them soft thrills in our little fun house
,,Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us
,,You me and all that stuff we're so scared of
,,Gotta ride down baby into this tunnel of love
,,
,,There's a crazy mirror showing us both in 5-D
,,I'm laughing at you you're laughing at me
,,There's a room of shadows that gets so dark brother
,,It's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love
,,
,,it ought to be easy ought to be simple enough
,,Man meets woman and they fall in love
,,But the house is haunted and the ride gets rough
,,And you've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above if you want to ride on down in through this tunnel of loveØ
,TWO FACES,I met a girl and we ran away
,,I swore I'd make her happy every day
,,And how I made her cry
,,Two faces have I
,,
,,Sometimes mister I feel sunny and wild
,,Lord I love to see my baby smile
,,Then dark clouds come rolling by
,,Two faces have I
,,
,,One that laughs one that cries
,,One says hello one says goodbye
,,One does things I don't understand
,,Makes me feel like half a man
,,
,,At night I get down on my knees and pray
,,Our love will make that other man go away
,,But he'll never say goodbye
,,Two faces have I
,,
,,Last night as I kissed you 'neath the willow tree
,,He swore he'd take your love away from me
,,He said our life was just a lie
,,And two faces have I
,,Well go ahead and let him try
,BRILLIANT DISGUISE,I hold you in my arms
,,as the band plays
,,What are those words whispered baby
,,just as you turn away
,,I saw you last night
,,out on the edge of town
,,I wanna read your mind
,,To know just what I've got in this new thing I've found
,,So tell me what I see
,,when I look in your eyes
,,Is that you baby
,,or just a brilliant disguise
,,
,,I heard somebody call your name
,,from underneath our willow
,,I saw something tucked in shame
,,underneath your pillow
,,Well I've tried so hard baby
,,but I just can't see
,,What a woman like you
,,is doing with me
,,So tell me who I see
,,when I look in your eyes
,,Is that you baby
,,or just a brilliant disguise
,,
,,Now look at me baby
,,struggling to do everything right
,,And then it all falls apart
,,when out go the lights
,,I'm just a lonely pilgrim
,,I walk this world in wealth
,,I want to know if it's you I don't trust
,,'cause I damn sure don't trust myself
,,
,,Now you play the loving woman
,,I'll play the faithful man
,,But just don't look too close
,,into the palm of my hand
,,We stood at the alter
,,the gypsy swore our future was right
,,But come the wee wee hours
,,Well maybe baby the gypsy lied
,,So when you look at me
,,you better look hard and look twice
,,Is that me baby
,,or just a brilliant disguise
,,
,,Tonight our bed is cold
,,I'm lost in the darkness of our love
,,God have mercy on the man
,,Who doubts what he's sure ofØ
,ONE STEP UP,Woke up this morning my house was cold
,,Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin'
,,Went out and hopped in my old Ford
,,Hit the engine but she ain't turnin'
,,We've given each other some hard lessons lately
,,But we ain't learnin'
,,We're the same sad story that's a fact
,,One step up and two steps back
,,
,,Bird on a wire outside my motel room
,,But he ain't singin'
,,Girl in white outside a church in June
,,But the church bells they ain't ringing
,,I'm sittin' here in this bar tonight
,,But all I'm thinkin' is
,,I'm the same old story same old act
,,One step up and two steps back
,,
,,It's the same thing night on night
,,Who's wrong baby who's right
,,Another fight and I slam the door on
,,Another battle in our dirty little war
,,When I look at myself I don't see
,,The man I wanted to be
,,Somewhere along the line I slipped off track
,,I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back
,,
,,There's a girl across the bar
,,I get the message she's sendin'
,,Mmm she ain't lookin' to married
,,And me well honey I'm pretending
,,Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms
,,The music was never-ending
,,We danced as the evening sky faded to black
,,One step up and two steps backØ
,WHEN YOU'RE ALONE,Times were tough love was not enough
,,So you said sorry Johnny I'm gone gone gone
,,You said my act was funny
,,But we both knew what was missing honey
,,So you let out on your own
,,Now that pretty form that you've got baby
,,Will make sure you get along
,,But you're gonna find out someday honey
,,
,,When you're alone you're alone
,,When you're alone you're alone
,,When you're alone you're alone
,,When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone
,,
,,Now I was young and pretty on the mean streets of the city
,,And I fought to make 'em my home
,,With just the shirt on my back I left and swore I'd never look back
,,And man I was gone gone gone
,,But there's things that'll knock you down you don't even see coming
,,And send you crawling like a baby back home
,,You're gonna find out that day sugar
,,
,,When you're alone you're alone
,,When you're alone you're alone
,,When you're alone you're alone
,,When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone
,,
,,I knew some day your runnin' would be through
,,And you'd think back on me and you
,,And your love would be strong
,,You'd forget all the bad and think only of all the laughs that we had
,,And you'd wanna come home
,,Now it ain't hard feelings or nothin' sugar
,,That ain't what's got me singing this song
,,It's just nobody knows baby where love goes
,,But when it goes it's gone gone
,,
,,When you're alone you're alone
,,When you're alone you're alone
,,When you're alone you're alone
,,When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone
,VALENTINE'S DAY,I'm driving a big lazy car rushin' up the highway in the dark
,,I got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's tremblin' over my heart
,,It's pounding baby like it's gonna bust right on through
,,And it ain't gonna stop till I'm alone again with you
,,
,,A friend of mine became a father last night
,,When we spoke in his voice I could hear the light
,,Of the skies and the rivers the timberwolf in the pines
,,And that great jukebox out on Route 39
,,They say he travels fastest who travels alone
,,But tonight I miss my girl mister tonight I miss my home
,,
,,Is it the sound of the leaves
,,left blown by the wayside
,,That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight
,,Is it the cry of the river
,,With the moonlight shining through
,,That ain't what scares me baby
,,What scares me is losing you
,,
,,They say if you die in your dreams you really die in your bed
,,But honey last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head
,,And God's light came shinin' on through
,,I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew
,,It wasn't the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me
,,It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true
,,It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms
,,No no baby it was you
,,So hold me close honey say you're forever mine
,,And tell me you'll be my lonely valentine
Human Touch,HUMAN TOUCH,You and me we were the pretenders
,,We let it all slip away

,,"Tell me, in a world without pity"
,,Do you think what I'm askin's too much
,,I just want something to hold on to
,,And a little of that Human Touch

,,
,,Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize
,,Well it comes at a hard hard price
,,You can't shut off the risk and the pain
,,Without losin' the love that remains
,,We're all riders on this train
,,
,,So you've been broken and you've been hurt
,,Show me somebody who ain't
,,"Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain"

,SOUL DRIVER,Rode through forty nights of the gospels' rain
,,"Black sky pourin' snakes, frogs"
,,And love in vain
,,You were down where the river grows wider
,,"Baby, let me be your soul driver"

,,Well if something in the air feels a little unkind
,,Don't worry darlin'
,,It'll slip your mind
,,I'll be your gypsy joker your shotgun rider
,,Baby let me be your soul driver
,,
,,Now no one knows which way love's wheel turns
,,Will we hit it rich
,,Or crash and burn
,,Does fortune wait or just the black hand of fate
,,This love potion's all we've got
,,One toast before it's too late
,,
,,If the angels are unkind or the season is dark
,,Or if in the end
,,Love just falls apart
,,Well then here's to our destruction
,,Baby let me be your soul driver

,,With a truckload of hundred thousand dollar bills
,,Man came by to hook up my cable TV
,,We settled in for the night my baby and me
,,We switched 'round and 'round 'til half-past dawn

,,Well now home entertainment was my baby's wish
,,So I hopped into town for a satellite dish
,,I tied it to the top of my Japanese car
,,I came home and I pointed it out into the stars
,,A message came back from the great beyond
,,There's fifty-seven channels and nothin' on
,,
,,Well we might'a made some friends with some billionaires
,,We might'a got all nice and friendly
,,If we'd made it upstairs
,,"All I got was a note that said ""Bye-bye John"
,,"Our love is fifty-seven channels and nothin' on"""
,,
,,So I bought a .44 magnum it was solid steel cast
,,And in the blessed name of Elvis well I just let it blast
,,'Til my TV lay in pieces there at my feet
,,And they busted me for disturbin' the almighty peace
,,"Judge said ""What you got in your defense son?"""

,,I fell in love with beautiful Doreen

,,And more than a little bit shy
,,Tonight I'll drink from her waters to quench my thirst
,,And leave the angels to worry

,,Down along the river's silent edge I soar

,SINALOA COWBOYS,Miguel came from a small town in northern Mexico.
,,He came north with his brother Louis to California three years ago
,,"They crossed at the river levee, when Louis was just sixteen"
,,And found work together in the fields of the San Joaquin
,,
,,They left their homes and family
,,"Their father said, ""My sons one thing you will learn,"
,,"for everything the north gives, it exacts a price in return."""
,,They worked side by side in the orchards
,,From morning till the day was through
,,Doing the work the hueros wouldn't do.
,,
,,Word was out some men in from Sinaloa were looking for some hands
,,"Well, deep in Fresno county there was a deserted chicken ranch"
,,And there in a small tin shack on the edge of a ravine
,,Miguel and Louis stood cooking methamphetamine
,,
,,You could spend a year in the orchards
,,Or make half as much in one ten hour shift
,,Working for the men from Sinaloa
,,But if you slipped the hydriodic acid
,,Could burn right through your skin
,,They'd leave you spittin' up blood in the desert
,,If you breathed those fumes in
,,
,,It was early one winter evening as Miguel stood watch outside
,,"When the shack exploded, lighting up the valley night"
,,Miguel carried Louis' body over his shoulder down a swale
,,"To the creekside and there in the tall grass, Louis Rosales died"
,,Miguel lifted Louis' body into his truck and then he drove
,,To where the morning sunlight fell on a eucalyptus grove
,,There in the dirt he dug up ten-thousand dollars. all that they'd saved
,,Kissed his brothers lips and placed him in his grave

,,we send 'em home and they come right back again
,,"Carl, hunger is a powerful thing."""
,,
,,Well I was good at doin' what I was told
,,kept my uniform pressed and clean
,,at night I chased their shadows
,,through the arroyos and ravines
,,
,,"drug runners, farmers with their families,"
,,young women with little children by their sides
,,come night we'd wait out in the canyons
,,and try to keep 'em from crossin' the line
,,
,,Well the first time that I saw her
,,she was in the holdin' pen
,,Our eyes met and she looked away
,,then she looked back again
,,her hair was black as coal
,,her eyes reminded me of what I'd lost
,,she had a young child cryin' in her arms
,,"and I asked, ""Senora, is there anything I can do"""
,,
,,There's a bar in Tijuana
,,where me and Bobby drink alongside
,,the same people we'd sent back the day before
,,we met there she said her name was Louisa
,,she was from sonora and had just come north
,,we danced and I held her in my arms
,,and I knew what I would do

,,At night they come across the levy
,,in the searchlights dusty glow
,,we'd rush 'em in our Broncos
,,and force 'em back down into the river below
,,she climbed into my truck
,,she leaned towards me and we kissed
,,as we drove her brothers shirt slipped open
,,and I saw the tape across his chest
,,
,,We were just about on the highway
,,when Bobby's jeep come up in the dust on my right
,,I pulled over and let my engine run
,,and stepped out into his lights
,,I felt myself movin'
,,felt my gun restin' 'neath my hand
,,we stood there starin' at each other
,,as off through the arroyo she ran
,,
,,Bobby Ramirez he never said nothin'
,,6 months later I left the line
,,I drifted to the central valley

,BALBOA PARK,He lay his blanket underneath the freeway
,,As the evening sky grew dark
,,Took a sniff of toncho from his coke can
,,And headed through Balboa Park
,,Where the men in their Mercedes
,,Come nightly to employ
,,In the cool San Diego evening
,,The services of the border boys
,,
,,He grew up near the Zona Norte
,,With the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with
,,He swallowed their balloons of cocaine
,,Brought 'em across the Twelfth Street strip
,,Sleeping in a shelter
,,If the night got too cold
,,Runnin' from the migra

,,Past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks
,,and in through the storm drain

,,He did what he had to do for the money

,,a big car come fast down the boulevard
,,spider stood caught in its headlights
,,got hit and went down hard

,,limped to his blanket 'neath the underpass
,,lie there tasting his own blood on his tongue
,,closed his eyes and listened to the cars
,,rushin' by so fast
,DRY LIGHTNING,I threw my robe on in the morning
,,Watched the ring on the stove turn to red
,,Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee
,,Pulled on my boots and made the bed

,,Kept bangin' me awake all night
,,As I look out the window
,,The only thing in sight
,,
,,Is dry lightning on the horizon line
,,Just dry lightning and you on my mind
,,
,,I chased the heat of her blood
,,Like it was the holy grail
,,Descend beautiful spirit
,,Into the evening pale
,,Her appaloosa's
,,Kickin' in the corral smelling rain
,,There's a low thunder rolling
,,'Cross the mesquite plain
,,But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line
,,It's just dry lightning and you on my mind
,,
,,I'd drive down to Alvarado street
,,Where she danced to make ends meet
,,I'd spend the night over my gin
,,As she'd talk to her men
,,
,,Well the piss yellow sun
,,Comes bringin' up the day
,,"She said ""ain't nobody gonna give nobody"

,,Now my days grow longer

,,Lookin' for that million-dollar sound
,,I got a little job down in Darlington
,,But some nights I don't go
,,"Some nights I go to the drive-in, or some nights I stay home"
,,I followed that dream just like those guys do up on the screen
,,And I drive a Challenger down Route 9 through the dead ends and all the bad scenes
,,"And when the promise was broken, I cashed in a few of my dreams"
,,
,,Well now I built that Challenger by myself
,,But I needed money and so I sold it
,,I lived a secret I should'a kept to myself
,,But I got drunk one night and I told it
,,All my life I fought this fight
,,The fight that no man can never win
,,Every day it just gets harder to live
,,This dream I'm believing in
,,"Thunder Road, oh baby you were so right"
,,Thunder Road there's something dyin' on the highway tonight
,,
,,I won big once and I hit the coast
,,But somehow I paid the big cost
,,Inside I felt like I was carryin' the broken spirits
,,Of all the other ones who lost
,,When the promise is broken you go on living
,,But it steals something from down in your soul
,,Like when the truth is spoken and it don't make no difference
,,Something in your heart goes cold
,,I followed that dream through the southwestern flats
,,That dead ends in two-bit bars
,,And when the promise was broken I was far away from home
,,Sleepin' in the back seat of a borrowed car
,,"Thunder Road, for the lost lovers and all the fixed games"
,,"Thunder Road, for the tires rushing by in the rain"
,,"Thunder Road, Billy and me we'd always say"

,,Hell's brewin' dark sun's on the rise
,,This storm'll blow through by and by
,,"House is on fire, Viper's in the grass"
,,A little revenge and this too shall pass
,,"This too shall pass, I'm gonna pray"
,,Right now all I got's this lonesome day
,,
,,It's alright... It's alright... It's alright
,,
,,Better ask questions before you shoot
,,Deceit and betrayals bitter fruit
,,"It's hard to swallow, come time to pay"
,,That taste on your tongue don't easily slip away
,,
,,Let kingdom come I'm gonna find my way
,,Through this lonesome dayØ
,INTO THE FIRE,The sky was falling and streaked with blood
,,I heard you calling me then you disappeared into the dust
,,"Up the stairs, into the fire"

,,Somethin' 'bout me and you
,,Never seein' one another again

,,Trying to figure out what went wrong

,,The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in
,,"The rush of your lips, the feel of your name"
,,"The beat of your heart, the devil's arcade"
,,
,,"You said heroes are needed, so heroes get made"
,,"Somebody made a bet, somebody paid"
,,"The cool desert morning, then nothin' to save"
,,Just metal and plastic where your body caved
,,The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray
,,"In the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name"
,,Where you lie adrift with the heroes
,,Of the devil's arcade
,,
,,You sleep and dream of your buddies Charlie and Jim
,,And wake with the thick desert dust on your skin
,,
,,"A voice says ""Don't worry, I'm here"""
,,Just whisper the word 'tomorrow' in my ear
,,"A house on a quiet street, a home for the brave"
,,The glorious kingdom of the sun on your face
,,Rising from a long night as dark as the grave
,,On a thin chain of next moments
,,And something like faith
,,"On a morning to order, a breakfast to make"
,,"A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits"
,,For the touch of your fingers
,,The end of a day
,,"The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart"

,,Gone in to that dark ether
,,Where you're still young n' hard and cold
,,Just like when they built you brother

,,Now your death is upon us
,,And we'll return your ashes to the Earth
,,And I know you'll take comfort in knowin'
,,You've been roundly blessed and cursed

Working on a Dream,OUTLAW PETE,He was born a little baby on the Appalachian Trail
,,At six months old he'd done three months in jail
,,He robbed a bank in his diapers and little bare baby feet
,,"All he said was ""Folks my name is Outlaw Pete"""
,,"I'm Outlaw Pete, I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?"
,,
,,At 25 a Mustang pony he did steal
,,And he rode her 'round and 'round on heaven's wheel
,,"Father Jesus I'm an outlaw, killer and a thief"
,,And I slow down only to sow my grief
,,"I'm Outlaw Pete, I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?"
,,
,,He cut his trail of tears across the countryside
,,And where he went women wept and men died
,,
,,One night he awoke from a vision of his own death
,,Saddled his pony and rode out deep into the West
,,Married a Navajo girl and settled down on the res.
,,And as the snow fell he held their beautiful daughter to his chest
,,"I'm Outlaw Pete, I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?"
,,Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
,,
,,Out of the East on an Irish stallion came bounty hunter Dan
,,His heart quickened and burdened by the need to get his man
,,He found Pete peacefully fishing by the river
,,Pulled his gun and got the drop
,,"He said ""Pete you think you've changed but you have not"""
,,
,,"He cocked his pistol pulled the trigger and shouted, ""Let it start"""
,,"Pete drew a knife from his boot, threw it,"
,,And pierced Dan through the heart
,,Dan smiled as he lay in his own blood dying in the sun
,,"Whispered in Pete's ear ""We cannot undo these things we've done"""
,,"You're Outlaw Pete, You're Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?"
,,Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
,,
,,For forty days & nights Pete rode and did not stop
,,Till he sat high upon an icy mountaintop
,,"He watched a hawk on a desert updraft, slip & slide"
,,Moved to the edge and dug his spurs deep into his pony's side
,,
,,Some say Pete and his pony vanished over the edge
,,And some say they remain frozen high up on that icy ledge
,,"A young Navajo girl washes in the river, her skin so fair"
,,And braids a piece of Pete's buckskin chaps into her hair
,,"Outlaw Pete, Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?"
,,Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
,,Can you hear me? Can you hear me?Ø

The Promise,RACING IN THE STREET,I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a 396
,,Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
,,She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
,,Outside the Seven-Eleven store
,,Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
,,And he rides with me from town to town
,,We only run for the money got no strings attached

,,Summer's here and the time is right

,,We take all the action we can meet
,,And we cover all the northeast state
,,When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street
,,From the fire roads to the interstate
,,Some guys they just give up living

,,Some guys come home from work and wash up
,,And go racin' in the street
,,
,,"Tonight, tonight the strip's just right"
,,I wanna blow 'em all out of their seats
,,"Calling out around the world, we're going racin' in the street"

,,I met her on the strip three years ago
,,In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.
,,I blew that Camaro off my back and drove that little girl away
,,But now there's wrinkles around my baby's eyes
,,And she cries herself to sleep at night
,,When I come home the house is dark
,,"She sighs ""Baby did you make it all right"""
,,She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
,,But all her pretty dreams are torn
,,She stares off alone into the night
,,With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
,,For all the shut down strangers and hot rod angels
,,Rumbling through this promised land
,,Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea
,,And wash these sins off our hands

,,Tonight tonight the highway's bright
,,Out of our way mister you best keep

,ROULETTE,We left the toys out in the yard
,,I took my wife and kids and left my home unguarded
,,We packed what we could into the car
,,No one here knows how it started
,,Suddenly everything was just so out of control
,,"Now I want some answers, mister, I need to know"
,,I hear all the talk but I don't know what you're sayin'
,,But I think I got a good idea of the game that you're playin'

,,"Roulette, that's the name"
,,"Roulette, that's the game now"
,,"Roulette, I don't know what they're sayin'"

,,I grew up here on this street
,,"Where nothin' moves, just a strange breeze"
,,In a town full of worthless memories
,,There's a shadow in my backyard
,,I've got a house full of things that I can't touch
,,Well all those things won't do me much good now

,,Down by the river that talks
,,The night speaks in searchlights
,,And shortwave radios squawk
,,The police patrol the streets
,,But I've left behind the man I used to be
,,Everything he believed and all that belonged to me
,,I tried to find my way out to somewhere where I thought it'd be safe
,,They stopped me at the roadblock they put up on the interstate
,,They put me in detention but I broke loose and then I ran
,,They said they want to ask me a few questions but I think they had other plans
,,Now I don't know who to trust and I don't know what I can believe
,,They say they want to help me but with the stuff they keep on sayin'
,,I think those guys just wanna keep on playin'
