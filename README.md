# Springsteen-Analysis

This project is an analysis of Springsteen songwriting over time. I collected lyrics data from brucespringsteen.net and Wikipedia using a combination of a data scraper and manual labor.

My analysis divided into two sections: 
    (1) structural changes over time and
    (2) content changes over time.
Additionally, a Python notebook is dedicated to cleaning and refining the database used in this analysis.

I made this blog post to explain my findings: https://medium.com/jackson-morton/bruce-springsteen-lyrics-analysis-1365f95f3c62#.ye29xnxn4
