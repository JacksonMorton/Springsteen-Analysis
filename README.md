# Springsteen-Analysis

This project in analysis of Springsteen songwriting over time. 

It's divided into two sections: 
    1. Structural changes over time
    2. Content changes over time
    
Additionally, a Python notebook is dedicated to cleaning and refining the database used in this analysis.
